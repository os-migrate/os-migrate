~~~
- Adds Logic to Unsubscribe RHEL Conversion Hosts. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds logic to unsubscribe systems from RHSM when using
  RHEL as the OS for a conversion host.  The unsubscribe is called
  for both the source and destination conversion hosts just before
  they are deleted.
- Creation of Floating IPs on migrated workloads. [Jiri Stransky]

  A new migration parameter 'floating_ip_mode' is added into the
  workload serialization. The current possible values are 'auto' and
  'skip'.

  * 'auto' means that floating IP creation is attempted for the VM, if
    the source VM had floating IP(s). The floating IP info is already
    being exported with the workload.

    Currently we only support auto-assignment of the floating IP
    address. (Exact assignment is typically not allowed by policy for
    tenants, but this should be investigated too.)

    Each floating IP serialization has a 'floating_network_ref'
    reference, which specifies the network where the floating IP should
    be created. The 'fixed_ip_address' parameter controls which
    port/address will the floating IP attach to.

  * 'skip' means that even if the workload serialization does include
    serialized floating IP subresources, their creation in destination
    cloud will not be attempted.

  The 'floating_ip_mode' parameter defaults to 'auto'.
- Parallel installation of conversion hosts. [Jiri Stransky]

  The updating and installing of packages on conversion hosts can take
  minutes. These actions were done in series until now (src then dst),
  but now they're done in parallel, which should speed up execution of
  the conversion host deployment playbook.
- Floating IP export for workloads (servers) [Jiri Stransky]

  When exporting servers, export information about their floating IPs.
- Guide for contributing changes to documentation. [Jiri Stransky]

  For developers, but also for users who find the docs lacking in some
  way. They can either report the issue on Github, or submit a patch
  with the changes.

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Convert to fully qualified collection names. [Carlos Camacho]

  Starting on Ansible 2.9 all tasks can use
  the fully defined collection name the builtin
  runtime is specified in:
  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/config/ansible_builtin_runtime.yml
- Pass through all RHSM parameters for conversion hosts. [Jiri Stransky]

  All parameters supported by the redhat_subscription Ansible module are
  now exposed as variables for the conversion host content installation.
- Shorter names for RHSM variables. [Jiri Stransky]

  The RHSM variables are renamed from previous pattern of
  e.g. 'os_migrate_conversion_host_content_rhsm_user' to
  e.g. 'os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_user' which is shorter but should
  still be descriptive enough and not risk a naming collision.

  The 'user' variable is also renamed to 'username' to match the
  parameter naming on the redhat_subscription module.
- Don't feed availability_zone_hints into requests when empty. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  The availability_zone_hints parameter for routers and networks can
  often be an empty list. Previously we've fed it as-is into the API
  requests. However, if the extension for network/router availability
  zones isn't enabled, this can cause the request to fail.

  We now only use the availability_zone_hints parameter when its not
  empty. This should have no effect on correctness, but it can prevent
  false-alarm failures.
- Resilient RHEL unregistration mechanism. [Jiri Stransky]

  Previously the deletion of RHEL conversion hosts would require the
  hosts to exist and always execute the unregisteration from RHSM. But
  if at least one of the hosts didn't exist, or the host got somehow
  damaged and wasn't reachable via ssh, the playbook would fail and
  would not delete the conversion hosts. The deletion playbook is now
  resilient in these scenarios and progresses towards ensuring the
  conversion hosts are deleted.
- Workload Source Check. [Ryan Brady]

  During the workload import, the code was checking the workload status
  via the export file.  If a server had been turned on or moved into
  another state other than "SHUTOFF" since the export occured, the
  workload import would fail.  This patch addresses that by checking
  the source cloud via the openstacksdk to ensure the workload status
  is "SHUTOFF" before attempting to migrate it.

Fix
~~~
- Loosen OpenStack operation timeouts in workload migration. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  The current timeout for OpenStack operations during workload migration
  is 10 minutes. This can be too short when working with large storage
  volumes. We should make the timeout configurable, but as first
  alleviation we increase the timeout to 30 minutes. This should still
  be enough to fail in reasonable time when things get stuck, but it
  shouldn't produce as many false alarms.
- Always stop on errors in conversion host deployment. [Jiri Stransky]

  Previously when the source or destination conversion host encountered
  some errror, Ansible would mark that host as failed and not run any
  other tasks there, but it would continue to run tasks on other hosts,
  most notably the migrator. This meant that e.g. subscription errors
  wouldn't stop the playbook immediately, and if conversion host
  deployment was included into a more complex migration playbook, the
  migration itself would fail much later with a non-obvious error. This
  is now fixed: whenever an error during conversion host deployment
  happens, the playbook stops right away.
- Fix image lookup for images owned by tenant. [Jiri Stransky]

  The `connection.image.find_image` method doesn't support filter
  arguments (like project_id), unlike other find methods. This caused
  failures when looking up images to be used for servers, when the image
  was owned by tenant (non-public).

  A custom image lookup method is now implemented in our reference.py
  module, utilizing `images()` rather than `find_image()`.

  End-to-end tests are also amended to test one workload spawned from
  public image, and one from tenant-owned image.
- Do not look up server image when boot_disk_copy: true. [Jiri Stransky]

  When migrating a server which is boot-from-image in source cloud, and
  boot-from-volume in destination cloud (due to setting `boot_disk_copy:
  true`), the server creation would still try to look up `image_ref` in
  the destination cloud, and fail if the image doesn't exist.

  This is now fixed. With `boot_disk_copy: true` we don't need any
  images in destination, so we no longer perform an image lookup.
- Fix building OS Migrate from source. [Jiri Stransky]

  The conditional for sourcing virtualenv was incorrect in the script,
  and virtualenv wasn't being sourced automatically. This is now fixed
  for users who want to build OS Migrate from source via the toolbox
  container.

~~~~~
- Oth: Documentation for 'floating_ip_mode' workload migration
  parameter. [Jiri Stransky]
- Pin openstacksdk version due to os_security_group_rule module
  breakage. [Jiri Stransky]

  The pin works around this breakage:

  'BadRequestException: 400: Client Error for url:
  http://10.0.110.233:9696/v2.0/security-group-rules, Unrecognized
  attribute(s) ''remote_address_group_id'''

  It seems like remote_address_group_id is fed into the request even
  though we're not specifying it, which makes the os_security_group_rule
  module incompatible with Train release and lower.
- Docs: include information in all roles. [Carlos Camacho]
- Update packages when deploying conversion hosts. [Jiri Stransky]

  I ran into a bug when trying to migrate workloads, the volume export
  step crashed with:

  qemu-img: Unable to initialize gcrypt

  It turns out there was desync in package versions, we were installing
  latest qemu-img but libgcrypt was old. We need to update to latest
  when deploying the conversion hosts.

0.6.0 (2020-11-25)
------------------

New
~~~
- Documentation for resource filters. [Jiri Stransky]
- Guide for using migration parameters. [Jiri Stransky]
- Include changelog in docs. [Carlos Camacho]

  This patch includes the changelog in the documentation automatically.

Changes
~~~~~~~
- User documentation improvements. [Jiri Stransky]

  Improve clarity of user docs in various spots and add more workload
  migration info to the walkthrough doc.
- Take info about server ports from Neutron. [Jiri Stransky]

  Previously we took it from Nova but that does not contain all the
  needed info for advanced use cases. Now we export info from Neutron
  which should allow us to export more port properties.

  The creation of ports during server import is still kept simple for
  now, via Nova. This has the benefit that if the server is deleted
  later, its ports are deleted automatically too. We may add an opt-in
  advanced port creation method via Neutron to support additional
  properties (e.g. setting a MAC address). However, IIUC, the ports
  created via Neutron don't get automatically deleted on server deletion
  and have to be cleaned up afterwards.
- More metadata to migrate with servers. [Jiri Stransky]

Fix
~~~
- Detach stuck volumes in unit tests. [Jiri Stransky]
- Revert to conditional empty variable check. [Carlos Camacho]

  Im following now the same approach we have in another
  variables check in the same makefile.
  Even if locally the check works in the job we have
  errors like: if [[ EUSE_TOOLBOX -eq "0" ]]; then \
  Notice that EUSE instead or REUSE
- Assign a default value for reusing the toolbox image. [Carlos Camacho]

  Currently, the container image build job is failing
  as we are calling the toolbox build without the
  variable TOOLBOX_BUILD. This patch defaults the value to 0
  if not defined, which means, build the container image.

Other
~~~~~
- Update contributing.rst. [Ryan Brady]

  minor edit, changed titles to title case
- Move resource checks from utility to Resource classes. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch moves the responsibility of comparing resources from
  the serialization class into the Resource class hierarchy so subclasses
  can add custom comparisons as needed.
- Store workload migration logs in a separate dir. [Jiri Stransky]

  Previously workload migration logs were stored directly in
  os_migrate_data_dir together with resource YAMLs. This meant that when
  migrating multiple workloads, the directory would get cluttered. Let's
  separate workload migration logs into its own directory.
- Reuse container images if possible. [Carlos Camacho]
- Preserve keypair when creating a server from an image. [Jiri Stransky]

  This will ensure ssh-ability of servers which were migrated using the
  from-image method. Naturally the ssh keypair needs to be migrated
  before migrating the server.
- Migration of rebuildable servers. [Jiri Stransky]

  * This enables the boot_disk_copy migration parameter for
    workloads. When it's `false`, server is booted from an image. When
    it's `true`, server boot disk is copied and the destination
    server is created as boot-from-volume.

  * Default value for boot_disk_copy depends on each server. Servers
    booted from a volume default to `true` (as that is the only sensible
    option), servers booted from an image default to `false`.

  * `image_ref` is added to the server serialization to track the Glance
    image that should be used to create the server.

  * E2e tests for workload migration are now testing these cases:

    * Instance booted from an image, with boot_disk_copy: false.

    * Instance booted from an image, with boot_disk_copy: true.
- Add migration param defaults to the resource class. [Jiri Stransky]

  This will allow us to assume that some keys exist in the migration
  params. We won't have to check for their existence before using them
  in code.
- Specify the image format. [Carlos Camacho]
- Create servers using proper Nova bindings, support server description.
  [Jiri Stransky]

  This commit moves us off old bindings for server creation onto the
  current ones. Points of interest:

  * Only `block_device_mapping` is now used for all volumes, we can get
    rid of special handling for `boot_volume_id`.

  * We can and do support the `description` parameter on servers.

  * The move forced changes in how we specify security groups and NICs
    but we still support the important features we supported before,
    e.g. fixed IP preservation.

  * In general this enable us to support more Nova API features /
    instance parameters.
- Resilience in e2e cleaning against failed migrations. [Jiri Stransky]

  If workload migration fails, volumes might still be attached to the
  conversion host(s) which prevents them from being deleted. Make sure
  they are detached before deleting.
- Stop busy-looping during volume transfer (fix for 100% CPU usage)
  [Jiri Stransky]

  The EAGAIN error code is used when polling, meaning there's no data to
  read right now but it should be tried again later. Instead of trying
  right away, sleep for a second. This will prevent Ansible from eating
  100% CPU on the migrator machine.
- Add Tenant(Project) Roles. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds the roles and supporting code to import and export
  OpenStack projects.
- Use an additional non-boot volume in e2e workload tests. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  This should improve our test coverage, only instance with no attached
  volumes was tested until now.
- Fix non-boot volume attachement. [Jiri Stransky]

  After migrating, the additional non-boot volume didn't attach onto the
  instance correctly, instead it was stuck in "reserved". This was due
  to malformed block_device_mapping_v2 data structure. See docs [1].
- Include lint checks. [Carlos Camacho]
- Export/import users with functional tests. [Carlos Camacho]
- Adjust docs job and build nightly image. [Carlos Camacho]


0.5.0 (2020-10-02)
------------------
- Add missing role readme files. [Jiri Stransky]

  Galaxy releasing fails without these.
- Release 0.5.0. [Jiri Stransky]
- Separates Functional Tests into Admin/Tenant. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch changes the func tests to run separately for both admin
  and tenant roles.  It follows the pattern done for the e2e testing
  a short time ago.
- Allow running e2e tests in smaller chunks for development. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  Currently running e2e tests does all this: deploy conversion hosts,
  seed pre-workload resources, then workload resources, then migrate
  pre-workload, then migrate workload, then clean everything up.

  For working on workload migration, it would be great if we could leave
  conversion hosts and pre-workload resources in place between test
  runs, and only cycle seed-migrate-clean on the actual workload. This
  is now implemented, but the default test run remains unchanged.

  First i can just run everything without cleaning up:

  ./toolbox/run bash -c "E2E_TEST_ARGS='--skip-tags test_clean_after -e test_clean_conversion_hosts_after=false' make test-e2e-tenant"

  And then i can run workload tests specifically, which will auto-clean
  before and after, but only the workload parts:

  ./toolbox/run bash -c "E2E_TEST_ARGS='--tags test_workload' make test-e2e-tenant"
- Put e2e scenario variables last. [Jiri Stransky]

  This allows them to also override the auth file, if desired.
- Add 'boot_disk_copy' migration parameter to workloads. [Jiri Stransky]

  Default it to true for now, as currently that's the only supported
  migration method.
- Move server creation logic into the resource class. [Jiri Stransky]
- Add _migration dict into resource serialization. [Jiri Stransky]

  Currently we have two dicts within the resource serialization:

  * params - parameters relevant for resource creation in destination
    cloud, and for idempotence,

  * _info - additional information about the resource from source cloud,
    which will not be passed on into the destination cloud when creating
    the resource.

  With work on migration of rebuildable instances, we will add a third one:

  * _migration - parameters for the migration process itself, not
    capturing properties of the resource, but rather *how* we want the
    resource to be migrated.

  The example use case here is the workload migration. There is one
  server in the source cloud but we have at least two options how to
  move it to destination:

  * full copy (current method) - root disk is copied as a volume, and
    the instance in the destination cloud is booted from that volume,

  * rebuild (to be implemented) - instance is booted from the same
    glance image in the destination cloud, putting the destination
    instance into a similar state as after using `openstack server
    rebuild` on the original. This is better suited for instances which
    are stateless or only save state on external volumes, not on the
    root disk.

  To distinguish how we want a given server migrated, we will have a
  parameter in the _migration section.
- Update wrong links. [Carlos Camacho]
- Foundation for running e2e tests as admin. [Jiri Stransky]
- Use separate tmp dir for e2e tests. [Jiri Stransky]
- Split file paths to prepare separate e2e tenant/admin tests. [Jiri
  Stransky]
- Prefix and shorten export variable names. [Jiri Stransky]

  We had a bunch of unprefixed variables like:

  export_networks_name_filter

  We should add the os_migrate prefix and we can perhaps shorten the
  variable name to still remain descriptive enough, like this:

  os_migrate_networks_filter

  The rename in this sense is applied across the project to all affected
  variables.

  This rename also opens up the possibility to use this filter on
  imports in the future, allowing to work on full YAML files while
  selecting just a few resources to import. It cannot be done right now
  because the stringfilter module only supports looking at direct
  attribute and not nested ones, so we cannot look at ['params']['name']
  presently. An enhancement for stringfilter could be implemented.
- Allow setting conversion subnet DNS separately for src/dst. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  DNS nameservers is a parameter for conversion subnet where it makes
  sense to allow different values between src/dst clouds.
- Fix readme and include a link to the project in the docs root. [Carlos
  Camacho]
- Filter exported images by the currently authenticated project. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  This kind of filtering is standard for our other resources, but for
  Glance images it was missing due to Glance API lack of functionality
  which translates into lack of functionality in the os_image_info
  Ansible module. The filtering is done explicitly in the playbook now.
- Docs refactor. [Carlos Camacho]
- (WIP) Adds Nova Idempotence Tests. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds idempotence tests for the Nova Flavor and Keypair
  resources.
- Include the fixed IP when restoring the server. [Carlos Camacho]

  The nics parameter is not documented in the upstream
  docs, also there is no way in inject the MAC address,
  or assign the floating IP when executing create_server

  This should be fixed by creating a port and assign it
  to the node before is created.
- Walkthrough doc updates and formatting fixes. [Jiri Stransky]

  This makes walkthrough doc up to date and generally into a better
  shape. Some notable changes:

  * Prerequisites section regarding authentication and parameters which
    are used for both pre-workload and workload migration is
    consolidated and moved at the beginning of the doc.

  * Nesting of headlines is fixed.

  * Removed mentions RH OSP.

  * Updated conversion host deployment to use the playbook instead of
    manual wiring instructions.

  * Updated the workload migration process to the new one which runs on
    plain CentOS and doesn't require VDDK.

  * Command shortcuts.
- Adds Roles For Nova Keypair Import and Export. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds the roles and associated code required to export
  and import Nova keypairs.
- Add an update test for images. [Jiri Stransky]
- Add idempotence tests for image export/import. [Jiri Stransky]
- Implement Glance image import. [Jiri Stransky]
- Fix pylint issues. [Jiri Stransky]

  It seems like pylint got updated and our code started failing the
  lint, this is now fixed.
- Adds Import and Export Roles for Nova Flavors. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds import and export roles, supporting files and tests
  for migrating Nova Flavors between clouds.
- Adds Nova services to the CI stack. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds the nova services to the stack to support functional
  tests.
- Export of Glance images. [Jiri Stransky]

  Since Glance images contain binary data, the export is done via two
  modules:

  * export_image_meta -- exports image metadata (YAML file)

  * export_image_blob -- exports image binary data

  The export of binary data is optional. This split between metadata and
  data exporting should leave us an open door towards migrating images
  in a direct way between clouds (e.g. via conversion hosts) rather than
  via the migrator host.
- Update user docs to use Keystone v2. [Carlos Camacho]
- Support migrations between keystone v2 and v3. [Carlos Camacho]
- Update references from 'master' branch to 'main' [Jiri Stransky]
- Allow configure the ssh user. [Carlos Camacho]
- These are the pending changes to allow using the centos image. [Carlos
  Camacho]

  We use become from vars and include internal DNS to
  be able to install packages.

  We also increase the timeout to create the conversion hosts to
  10 minutes, and change the default image to be CentOS.
- Adds Role to Install Conversion Host Content. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds a role to install content for the conversion host
  conditionally.  The role currently supports CentOS and RHEL but
  is written in a way that should be simple to add additional OS
  support if needed in the future.
- Adds Link For Contributing To Developer Doc. [Ryan Brady]

  Adds a link for the the contributing doc to the README.
- Adds Contribution Document. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds information to help a potential contributor add
  new roles or supporting code to the project.
- Fixes Walkthrough Images. [Ryan Brady]

  When the walkthrough doc was merged, the URIs for the images were
  incorrect and the images were not displayed for users.  This patch
  fixes the URIs for the images to the correct path and removed an
  erroneous TODO comment left in the previous version.
- Fully qualified refs in workload serialization. [Jiri Stransky]
- Add Matthew into authors. [Jiri Stransky]
- Use cgroupfs as cgroup manager in Github Actions. [Jiri Stransky]
- Format variable names as code. [Jiri Stransky]
- Restructure user documentation landing page. [Jiri Stransky]

  Remove the walkthrough-like part of the root user readme, we have a
  specific Walkthrough doc now. Make the main readme a link directory.
- Configuring the conversion host. [Carlos Camacho]
- Fully qualified refs in network serialization. [Jiri Stransky]
- Fully qualified refs in security groups and rules serialization. [Jiri
  Stransky]
- Fully qualified refs in router and router interface serialization.
  [Jiri Stransky]
- Fully qualified refs in subnet serialization. [Jiri Stransky]
- Adds Walkthrough Document. [Jiri Stransky, Matthew Arnold, Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds documentation for executing a parallel cloud migration
  using os-migrate.
- Fix. [Carlos Camacho]
- Improve variable naming consistency in conversion host playbook. [Jiri
  Stransky]


0.4.1 (2020-06-26)
------------------
- Prepare release of 0.4.1. [Jiri Stransky]
- Fix. [Carlos Camacho]


0.4.0 (2020-06-26)
------------------
- Prepare release 0.4.0. [Jiri Stransky]

  Mainly utilizes a new workload migration approach with new conversion
  host and conversion host deployment/deletion playbooks.
- Fix subnet update test. [Jiri Stransky]

  The lineinfile module only makes sure one line is present. So after it
  does its replacement in one spot, it stops replacing. Due to random
  order of subnets in the file, it sometimes replaces the description of
  the wrong subnet, resulting in intermittent failures. To make the
  tests work, we simply replace descriptions of both subnets in the func
  test, and then we check only one.

  To keep tests consistent, use 'replace' instead of 'lineinfile' module
  in other tests too.
- Variables cleanup. [Carlos Camacho]

  This patch makes the variables used in the
  configurable so we can trigger different scenarios
  just changing this default file.

  Also separates the network/flavor/image names for
  src/dst conversion hosts

  And remove some required variables that can be safely
  defaulted.
- Adds Functional Update Test for Security Groups. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds a test to ensure the updates for security group
  resources is working properly.
- Adds Update Functional Tests for Subnets. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds the code to test the update functionality of the
  subnet resources.
- Adds Functional Test for Network Update. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds a functional test to ensure that updates are working
  for the network resource.
- Adds Functional Update Test For Router Resources. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds a test to ensure updates work for router resources.
- Use conversion host deployment/deletion playbooks in CI. [Jiri
  Stransky]
- Set up conversion hosts to talk to each other. [Jiri Stransky]

  A separate ssh key is used to connect from dst conversion host to src
  conversion host, so that user can't mistakenly upload their own
  private key into the conversion host.
- Fix Resource Updates. [Jiri Stransky, Ryan Brady]

  For the resources that support updating, the code previously called
  the update sending the resource name causing the update to fail
  from the corresponding API with a "BadRequest" error.  This patch
  updates the code to use the instance of the resource itself when
  calling the associated update method.
- Hack for conversion host reachability in CI. [Jiri Stransky]
- Update workload exporting for new openstacksdk. [Jiri Stransky]
- Make sure we respect virtualenv in playbooks. [Jiri Stransky]

  When we run our playbooks, it seems that virtualenv is ignored even
  when it's active for the ansible-playbook command invocation. We set
  it into the inventory explicitly, so that when venv is active for
  ansible-playbook invocation, it will also be active for the Ansible
  modules invocations.
- Print whether we're sourcing venv or not in Makefile. [Jiri Stransky]
- Fix timeout logic on snapshot creation. [Jiri Stransky]

  In CI we're hitting this error:

      File "/tmp/ansible_os_migrate.os_migrate.import_workload_export_volumes_payload_4g3ps56s/ansible_os_migrate.os_migrate.import_workload_export_volumes_payload.zip/ansible_collections/os_migrate/os_migrate/plugins/modules/import_workload_export_volumes.py", line 364, in _detach_data_volumes_from_source
      AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'id'

  Looks like the call to create snapshot returns None. We'll try moving
  the timeout into the call itself and using wait=True.
- Add playbooks for deployment and deletion of conversion hosts. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  Deploys and deletes the conversion hosts including supporting
  resources like networking, security group, and key pair. The
  deployment and deletion are within a single role to make use of common
  defaults file.
- Relax YAML lint - allow 100 character lines. [Jiri Stransky]

  The 80 character limit is a bit too strict for dealing with long
  Ansible variables. 100 characters should still be comfortable enough
  for modern screens.
- Update uch image. [Carlos Camacho]
- Gitignore local directory. [Jiri Stransky]

  This directory allows putting some personal files in, e.g. credential
  or parameter files for manual testing. This directory is available in
  `./toolbox/venv-shell` containers.
- Use nbdkit if available with fallback to qemu-nbd. [Matthew Arnold]
- Clean up temporary volumes and SSH processes. [Matthew Arnold]
- Create destination instance and attach volumes. [Matthew Arnold]

  Also add number/names of networks, without preserving MAC addresses.
- Transfer exported volumes to destination. [Matthew Arnold]

  Also factor out common code between source and destination conversion hosts.
- Export volumes from source conversion host. [Matthew Arnold]
- Fix exporting router interfaces when router name filter is undefined.
  [Jiri Stransky]

  Just a missing default.

  Closes https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate/issues/201
- Docs for publishing a release. [Jiri Stransky]
- Make sure that docs CI passes 'functional' test automatically too.
  [Jiri Stransky]

  Without this a pull request seems to be able to get stuck waiting for
  the functional test to complete.


0.3.1 (2020-06-05)
------------------
- Prepare release 0.3.1. [Jiri Stransky]
- Fix exporting router interfaces when router name filter is undefined.
  [Jiri Stransky]

  Just a missing default.

  Closes https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate/issues/201

  (cherry picked from commit fc81f87d147980aae45f205959d42628885f4b36)


0.3.0 (2020-06-02)
------------------
- Add readme files to all roles, pointing to user docs. [Jiri Stransky]

  It looks like this is now required, otherwise the Galaxy publish
  script fails with:

  ERROR! Galaxy import process failed: No role readme found. (Code: None)
- Prepare the release of 0.3.0. [Jiri Stransky]
- Adds additional user docs. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds more data to the repo README and updates the
  the user doc to remove clouds.yml info and replace it with
  the newer auth vars.
- Reintroduce project filtering into workload migration idempotence
  check. [Jiri Stransky]

  This was added earlier but errorneously, reporting that server exists
  even if it wasn't true, so it had to be reverted. The project id
  filtering is now reintroduced into the workload migration idempotence
  check, and it doesn't produce false positives.
- Include the workload migration. [Carlos Camacho]
- Add dst filters to workload migration. [Jiri Stransky]

  This is only necessary when looking up the conversion host and when
  checking for idempotence. The actual workload migration uses the VM's
  ID from _info, so it should be already good to go:

  https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate/blob/2aa04ad4c2cf6d1e8abb24f845c7c9009fcd58fd/os_migrate/plugins/modules/import_workload_prelim.py#L297
- Include network mappings in wrapper input. [Matthew Arnold]
- Import lookups filtering by project_id for pre-workload migration.
  [Jiri Stransky]
- Rename export_prelude role to prelude_src. [Jiri Stransky]

  I realized that e.g. workload import might need to fetch authenticated
  project IDs for both src and dst. Rather than having an export/import
  prelude, it may make more sense to have prelude roles for interacting
  with src/dst clouds.
- Add project id filter to the remaining export roles. [Jiri Stransky]

  By default, make sure we export only resources in the currently
  autheticated project.
- Remove unused (and incorrect) os_security_group_rules_info. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  This isn't used and it's not utilizing the filters parameter correctly.
- Implement export filter for resources in current project (for
  networks) [Jiri Stransky]

  This adds the reusable code for fetching current project ID and
  setting a general export filter with that project ID by
  default. Networks export is amended to make use of this filtering
  parameter.
- Adds test for Router Interface idempotence. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds a test to ensure router interface idempotence and
  updates the router interface resource class to handle the case
  when a router interface already exists when attempting to create
  an identical one.

  This patch also fixes a small bug in the router interface where
  it was using the "subnet_name" key where it should have been
  using a "subnet_id" key.  This was causing the unintended behavior
  of never finding a matching port when checking for ports that may
  have already been created, so it always tried to create the port
  leading to conflicts.
- Capture wrapper stdout/stderr to data directory. [Matthew Arnold]
- Split import_workload into two modules. [Matthew Arnold]

  The 'prelim' module configures everything right up to the point of
  running the virt-v2v-wrapper container, and returns paths to the
  expected log and state files at that point. The import_workload module
  just runs the container, so it will still sit without showing progress
  for potentially a very long time - but this way the operator can
  optionally monitor the previously-provided log files as needed.
- Ansible automation for the e2e tests. [Carlos Camacho]
- Adds Functional Test for Security Group Rule Idempotence. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds a functional test to ensure security group rule idempotence.
- Make sure releasing is done from toolbox container. [Jiri Stransky]

  E.g. if shyaml is missing, the releasing will fail with a weird
  error. In toolbox, we have all the releasing dependencies.
- Prepare for 0.0.2 release to Galaxy. [Jiri Stransky]
- First attempt at workload migration. (#170) [Matthew Arnold]

  First attempt at workload migration.

  This runs virt-v2v-wrapper on the destination conversion host.


  Squashed commits from review process:

  * Rename uci_container_id to uci_container_image.

  * Remove flavor and security_groups objects from info.

  * Rename ssh_key_path to clarify what it is used for.

  * Pass auth parameters straight through to wrapper.

    No longer forces password authentication.

  * Rename server_address module to conversion_host_info.

  * Allow specifying conversion hosts with name or ID.

  * Include remote wrapper directory in return value.

    This helps debug migration failures.

  * Remove flavor_id from Server's info_from_sdk.

  * Run UCI container with host networking.
- Save ether_type for security group rules. [Jiri Stransky]

  This is a fundamental property of the rule, specifies whether the rule
  applies to IPv4 or IPv6 traffic.
- Adds Router Idempotence Fuctional Test. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds a test to ensure idempotence for the router resource.
- Move instance name from info to params. [Matthew Arnold]
- Basic workload information export. [Matthew Arnold]

  Export instance information from a source OpenStack cloud to
  workloads.yml. Actual workload migration will require saving more
  properties than this, but they will get filled in later.
- Allow skipping func test cleanup only after testing. [Jiri Stransky]

  Previously it was possible to skip cleanup via `--skip-tags
  test_clean`, but that would affect cleanup both before and after
  testing. It is now possible to skip the cleanup only after testing,
  with `--skip-tags test_clean_after`.
- Fix importing router external gateway. [Jiri Stransky]

  Previously routers were created without an external gateway interface,
  this is now fixed. The interface is created on the network with the
  same name as in the source cloud.
- Make sure router import/export doesn't fail if external gateway is not
  present. [Jiri Stransky]
- Add a Router import playbook. [Jiri Stransky]
- Force upgrade virtualenv. [Carlos Camacho]
- Galaxy sanity checks. [Carlos Camacho]
- Check build for docs folder. [Carlos Camacho]
- Do not ls, use always current version as latest. [Carlos Camacho]
- Fixes Subnet Update. [Ryan Brady]

  Intermittently, the subnet import functional tests fail for ip_version
  or network_id attributes.  This patch adds a readonly_params collection
  to the Resource class and strips out any readonly properties during an
  attempt to update.  For the Subnet resource this patch removes the
  blacklisted properties in neutron source for the subnet resource
  (project_id, network_id) from the update args.

  A follow up issue and series of patches is forthcoming for adding
  functional testing for the update on all resources.

  closes #142
- Document class vars in Resource. [Jiri Stransky]
- Fixes Subnet Update. [Ryan Brady]

  Intermittently, the subnet import functional tests fail for ip_version
  or network_id attributes.  This patch adds a readonly_params collection
  to the Resource class and strips out any readonly properties during an
  attempt to update.  For the Subnet resource this patch removes the
  blacklisted properties in neutron source for the subnet resource
  (project_id, network_id) from the update args.

  A follow up issue and series of patches is forthcoming for adding
  functional testing for the update on all resources.

  closes #142
- Update dev docs. [Jiri Stransky]

  The dev docs for running functional tests went out of date as we
  changed auth mechanism and as we changed how to run a subset of
  functional tests. They are now updated to current workflows.

  Also slight edit has been made to the design doc now that we've made
  some implementation decisions where previously there was uncertainty.
- Start polishing the Galaxy sanity check to publish the collection.
  [Carlos Camacho]

  There are several checks we need to pass in order to be able
  to publish the collection in both Galaxy and the Automation Hub.

  This will be the first change to make it possible.

  With this, we can pass the required to publish into galaxy.
- OOP security group rules. [Carlos Camacho]
- Move README. [Carlos Camacho]
- Remove old auth mechanism. [Jiri Stransky]

  The removal will make sure that we cannot depend on the old
  clouds.yaml based auth mechanism and usage of new auth is enforced.
- Switch func tests seed/clean/verify to new auth. [Jiri Stransky]

  We already have new auth used in all modules, but the func test code
  still used the old auth. Switch func tests too.
- Switch remaining modules to new auth. [Jiri Stransky]

  This swithces the remaining Ansible modules (for routers, router
  interfaces, subnets, security groups, security group rules) into using
  the new auth mechanism.
- Move Network to use transferable auth instead of named clouds. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  This move Network to use an auth mechanism that we can use also with
  Universal Conversion Hosts (something that is easily pushable as data
  rather than having to reference a clouds.yaml file).
- Script to extract auth info from clouds.yml. [Jiri Stransky]

  We'll need to stop using named clouds because we'll need to feed
  credentials into universal conversion host, we can't simply copy
  user's clouds.yml there. So let's start moving towards the other auth
  mechanism used - auth + auth_type + region_name. IIUC should still
  support advanced mechanisms like Application Credentials, via
  different values in auth_type and corresponding auth dictionary.
- Fix subnet import idempotence. [Jiri Stransky]

  The last param that must be sorted for import idempotence to work is
  'host_routes'. It's a list of dicts so it needs a list of keys to look
  at in each dict. The list-of-dicts sorting is implemented in Resource
  class to be reusable.
- OOP sec group. [Carlos Camacho]
- Split security groups and rules from networks. [Carlos Camacho]
- Remove Transible code to cleanup the repo structure. [Jiri Stransky]

  We're not using it, and where OS-Migrate is heading now, it doesn't
  seem we will literally need to take parts from it. It can only confuse
  folks who try to understand OS-Migrate, making them think that the
  code under openstack_ansible directory is being used for the
  migration. If we need to revive any of that code, we can find it in
  git history.
- Add Sagi as a co-author. [Jiri Stransky]

  The Transible code from Sagi has been an inspiration for parts of what
  we do in OS-Migrate.
- Fix Subnet Update. [Ryan Brady]

  During the idempotency testing, the subnet update calls to the API
  failed for ip_version and network_id.  These parameters are accepted
  for the create, but not the update.  Sorting the allocation_pools and
  dns_nameservers migtigated the condistion that caused this error.
- Lint target needs to make sure the collection is installed. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  Otherwise it fails with:

      Couldn't parse task at
      /root/os_migrate/tests/func/idempotence/security_group.yml:28
      (couldn't resolve module/action
      'os_migrate.os_migrate.os_security_groups_info'. This often
      indicates a misspelling, missing collection, or incorrect module
      path.
- Fixes CI. [Ryan Brady]

  The CI started failing today when attempting to run the checkout
  source step.  I started researching online and found there is a
  race condition issue with the actions/checkout@v1[1].  This patch
  changes the checkout action to use @v2 which supposedly addresses
  this issue.

  [1] https://github.com/actions/checkout/issues/23
- Security Group Idempotence Test. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds idempotence tests for security group import and export.

  partially-addresses: #21
- Router interfaces import. [Jiri Stransky]

  Import interfaces which Routers have in tenant Subnets. This is a more
  advanced resource than the basic "CRUD" approach. First we need to
  create a port with the desired IP addresses in the desired subnets,
  and then we attach those ports to the router. This ensures that the
  router interface IP addresses in tenant networks are migrated without
  change.
- Router interfaces export. [Jiri Stransky]

  Export information about interfaces which Routers have in Subnets.
- Subnet Idempotence Testing. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds idempotence test for subnet import and export.

  partially-addresses #21
- Adds Subnets Import Role. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds the ability to import subnets from a os_migrate
  yaml structure.
- Use mysql service instead. [Carlos Camacho]
- Run using the mysql service. [Carlos Camacho]
- Add basic import of Routers. [Jiri Stransky]

  Import routers. Some params were refused on the router creation
  request so i had to move them to 'info'.
- Refactor router export via Resource subclass. [Jiri Stransky]

  The router functionality is just export right now, let's first
  refactor it as Resource subclass before we add import.
- Subnets Refactor. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch refactors the export subnets role to use the new
  Resource class.
- Default implementation for Resource.create_or_update. [Jiri Stransky]

  By extracting the find/create/update calls for the underlying SDK
  object, we can provide a default implementation for the
  create_or_update method on Resource. Subclasses can either provide the
  find/create/update mini-methods and reuse the create_or_update logic,
  or override the create_or_update method fully.
- Do not lint YAML files in ./tests/func/tmpdata. [Jiri Stransky]

  These resource files are generated in tests via YAML dumper and they
  don't pass the lint check on indentation :).

  Also reformat the linters.sh file to make the commands a bit easier to
  read.
- Remove begining of line. [Carlos Camacho]
- Run ansible-lint last, feed all files into a single process. [Carlos
  Camacho, Jiri Stransky]

  Ansible-lint is the slowest linter, running it last should speed up
  catching Python and YAML lint issues via `test-fast` target.

  Also feeding all files into a single ansible-lint process seems to be
  much faster than running ansible-lint per file.
- Fix YAML nits. [Carlos Camacho]
- Python lint checks. [Carlos Camacho]
- Introduce Resource class. [Jiri Stransky, Ryan Brady]

  We created a Resource class as the base class for all our exported
  resources. It improves the DRYness of our overall code and is suitable
  for both export and import. It uses method composition internally so
  that it can be easily "disconnected from network" for purposes of unit
  testing.

  The common interfaces are now backwards compatible, e.g. the
  add_or_replace method for exporting resources now accepts both direct
  resource data or an instance of Resource.
- Fis bashate. [Carlos Camacho]
- Run Ansible lint. [Carlos Camacho]
- Fix podman's TTY-related options in vagrant-run. [Jiri Stransky]

  The TTY-related options passed to create vs. start are not perfect
  substitutes of each other.

  * When calling `start`, we want to always pass `-a` even when not in
    interactive shell, simply to avoid launching the container in
    background (`podman start` ~= `podman run -d`; `podman start -a` ~=
    `podman run`).

  * There is no `-t` equivalent for `podman start`. It looks like we
    need to decide on allocating pseudo-TTY in `podman create`.

  * I'm not 100% sure on the `-i` behavior but from docs it looks like
    we either want to pass it to both or neither.
- Allow running functional tests more individually. [Jiri Stransky]

  Now one can run this to run only Network tests for example:

  ./toolbox/run bash -c "FUNC_TEST_ARGS='--tags test_network' make test-func"

  or Network + Subnet tests:

  ./toolbox/run bash -c "FUNC_TEST_ARGS='--tags test_network,test_subnet' make test-func"

  Special new use case is:

  ./toolbox/run bash -c "FUNC_TEST_ARGS='--tags test_clean' make test-func"

  which will only clean up the test data from the named clouds.
- Implement Router export. [Jiri Stransky]

  Note that this doesn't export router's interfaces on private subnets,
  they will have to be exported/imported via a separate resource.
- Write resource correctly when iterating over resources. [Carlos
  Camacho]

  We are writing only the last item in the array to the output file.

  Closes:#100
- Import security groups and rules. [Carlos Camacho]

  Including unit and functional tests.
- Registry.fedoraproject.org consistently fails on pulling images.
  [Carlos Camacho]

  We had several CI issues related to errors when pulling the
  container image from registry.fedoraproject.org

  Maybe we wont hit this anymore if we use Docker Hub.
  Also, the image shuold be exactly the same.
- Include functional tests from exporting security groups and security
  group rules. [Carlos Camacho]

  We also change the way we query for the security group and rules
  before, we were querying the old API which returns a Munch object
  instead of the API object we were waiting for.
- Correct $HOME ownership in vagrant-run and vagrant-shell. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  I was considering several options how to solve the issue of incorrect
  $HOME ownership in containers:

  * Give the user sudo rights to do the chown in entrypoint. Bad mainly
    because we don't know which user we'll run as when creating the
    container image, and for sudo to work in a container we also need to
    mount in /etc/shadow (even when using NOPASSWD sudo).

  * Launch the container as root, perform chown in its entrypoint, and
    then `su` to another user (we'd pass it in via env variable) to run
    the real command. Better than previous but reimplementing the
    `--user` argument of `podman run` via an env variable and custom
    entrypoint still feels somewhat suboptimal, especially if Vagrant is
    not the only use case for the os_migrate_toolbox image.

  * First create the container without starting it, tweak the
    container's filesystem as needed via `podman mount`, and then start
    the container.

  The last options feels the cleanest and it's the one implemented in
  this commit.
- Add validation of unique resource naming. [Jiri Stransky]

  This adds validation of resource files. Unique resource naming in
  ensured per resource type. Multiple resource files can be fed into the
  validation, so if someone had a resource file setup where resources of
  the same type are spread across multiple files, the names would still
  get validated properly.

  Validation can currently be executed in 2 ways:

  * After loading resources, before importing them (can be disabled by a
    boolean flag).

  * Independently on all resources in a directory via validate_data_dir
    playbook.
- Adds Subnet Export. [Ryan Brady]

  This patch adds the ability to export subnets from an openstack
  cloud into a yaml file.
- Use id-based iteration for Security Groups and Security Group Rules.
  [Carlos Camacho]
- Including matching id by name for the security group name on rules
  param section. [Carlos Camacho]

  This commit adds the parameter security_group_name
  to the params section.

  Closes #79
- Update Vagrant-Devstack setup to Fedora 30. [Jiri Stransky]

  Fedora 29 is no longer supported.

  Closes https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate/issues/74
  Closes https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate/issues/65
- Adding the export security groups and security group rules. [Carlos
  Camacho]

  This patch exports the current deployed security
  groups into the yaml os-migrate format.

  It also export each security group rule per
  security group.
- Functional CI fixes. [Jiri Stransky]

  This moves the container build earlier in the functional CI. There
  seem to be flakes recently in the image build, and moving it earlier
  in the CI steps should help us fail faster.

  Also it makes sure that devstack is ran from /home/stack when it is
  ran as stack user. We hit weird ownership issues when running as
  `stack` user but devstack is under `/home/runner`.
- Assert correct os_migrate_version when loading files. [Jiri Stransky]

  Currently we do not guarantee any backward/forward compatibility in
  serialized files. Using different version of OS-Migrate between export
  and import isn't supported. Should users get to a situation where
  differing versions are needed between export and import, they will
  have to investigate the risks and e.g. `sed` the version in files to
  the expected one. We're defaulting to being defensive here.

  I was thinking whether this could go into validations as one of the
  validation errors, but in fact if the versions are different, we
  cannot even guarantee that the validations will work correctly, so
  let's be careful and just raise a clear exception right away.

  Closes https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate/issues/20
- Allow duplicate names on export - iterate over resources by ID. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  We want to export the resources as they are, even if they'd fail
  validation e.g. due to duplicate naming. Validation will be performed
  on the exported files and/or prior to importing.

  This requires an amendment to stringfilter to be able to filter a list
  of dicts and not just a simple list of strings. The `attribute`
  optional argument is added. This is consistent with behavior of
  Ansible's `sort` filter. By default it operates on flat lists, but
  with `attribute` argument it can be made to operate on lists of dicts.
- Decide resource sameness on export by ID rather than name. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  This change is fueled by work on validations. We have essentially 2
  options there:

  * Export all resources including ones with empty name and duplicate
    names. Then run validatiton on the exported files. This requires
    that resources are iterated over for export by ID and not by name.

    This is nicer because the files can be perhaps edited by hand to
    amend the naming on destination cloud without forcing name changes
    on source cloud. Validation can be re-ran arbitrarily on the files
    to iterate forward.

  * Validate the state in the source cloud to verify whether export can
    be ran, and change the state in the source cloud until unique naming
    is achieved. Then run export.

    This is less nice because amendments of the source cloud are
    necessary before an export can be performed.

  To achieve the former (nicer) option, we need to start exporting by
  ID. First step, which is done in this commit, is to amend the resource
  sameness check which is used during export to figure out if a resource
  should be added into a file or if it's already present.
- Do not enable non-existent Copr repo. [Jiri Stransky]

  Ian's copr repo was fixing iSCSI in Fedora but it doesn't exist
  anymore. Let's just remove it because we don't need Nova instances
  working right now, and we'll probably be moving onto Fedora 30 or
  CentOS 8 subsequently.
- Fix prerequisites for Devstack. [Jiri Stransky]

  python2 is needed because `/usr/bin/env python` must work, and
  python3-pyyaml must be absent.
- Better devstack logging. [Jiri Stransky]

  Use the LOGFILE variable supported by devstack, instead of `tee`.
- Initialize vagrant storage pool in vagrant-destroy if needed. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  This way you can call ./vagrant-destroy right after starting
  vagrant-shell. Previously it would complain that the pool doesn't
  exist. The libvirt session for vagrant is transient and the pool gets
  lost every time the container is stopped, but the storage content is
  not lost and the pool can simply be recreated on top of the same dir.
- Allow local edits in Devstack. [Jiri Stransky]

  Now when devstack fails, you can edit files locally and run `vagrant
  provision` to retry.
- Do not build container with Vagrant in CI. [Jiri Stransky]

  We don't need Vagrant in CI and it pulls a lot of deps, skipping its
  installation in CI should speed up the jobs.
- Fix checker of resource sameness, add tests for it. [Jiri Stransky]

  When two resources have the same type but their names are undefined,
  we should not consider them the same. This is now the case after a
  copypasta typo is fixed, and tests are added to verify correct
  behavior.
- Implement generic idempotence checker. [Jiri Stransky]

  The resource_needs_update function should be generically usable on all
  our resources to check whether some resource is in target state or
  needs update (= idempotence checks). It is right away plugged into the
  check method for Network.
- Simplify and speed up Network functional tests by using name filter.
  [Jiri Stransky]

  This ensures we only export the network we're interested in and we
  don't have to hack the resulting file. There is also slight speedup
  due to making fewer API calls.
- Implement advanced name filtering (exact match, regex) [Jiri Stransky]

  This adds a new filter plugin 'stringfilter' which allows advanced
  conditioning which resources to export, by their name. Either by exact
  match or regular expression match, on the names of resources that we
  want to export.
- Document reusable module_utils functions and network functions. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  Documents what our functions (especially the reusable ones that are
  intended to be shared) should do.

  Since Pydoc is a free-form format, i went for very simple way of
  describing the functions, trying to maximize the information provided
  per characters typed and limit rigid boilerplate. This should help us
  be diligent about documenting the functions by making documentation
  not much pain to write :).
- Adapt conventions based on Security Groups discussion. [Jiri Stransky]

  Work on Security Groups spawned a discussion about some
  conventions. This patch performs following adaptation:

  * Use '_info' instead of 'info' for resource properties which are
    irrelevant for importing and idempotence checks. This should further
    reduce a chance of conflict with some real property and allow us to
    ignore any '_info' *also in nested dicts* when importing / checking
    idempotence.

  * Better namespacing for Network type
    serialization. 'openstack.network.Network' rather than
    'openstack.network'.

  * Resource field names for type/params/_info are now constants to

- Use tab in Makefile. [Jiri Stransky]

  This is make's weirdness, it wants tabs. Here the spaces worked by
  accident since they weren't the beginning of a recipe, rather inside a
  bash multi-liner. But it can throw off indentation, so let's stick to
  tabs everywhere.
- Initial user documentation. [Jiri Stransky]
- Make sure toolbox container RPMs are up-to-date when building. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  We install a bunch of (latest) RPMs but until now we didn't update the
  others. This could result in a mixture of RPMs that has never been
  tested together in Fedora. Let's update packages before installing
  additional ones.
- Remove Tmit PoC build requirements. [Jiri Stransky]

  I thought i was pasting just vagrant-libvirt package list but in fact
  pasted full Tmit build package list. We don't need the Rust bits in
  OS-Migrate.

  GCC needs to be explicitly added because it was an unstated dependency
  pulled in by the previous package list.
- Use tags in functional tests instead of separate playbooks. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  To run subset of functional tests, the current pattern was to create a
  full playbook which would only include the desired parts.

  An alternative pattern might be to use --skip-tags or --tags with the
  test_all.yml playbook. This might allow better mix-and-match execution
  for particular test environments and developer scenarios.

  Due to env vars not being automatically passed into the toolbox
  container, currently there are two ways to test this approach e.g. by
  skipping the network tests:

      ./toolbox/shell
      FUNC_TEST_ARGS='--skip-tags test_network' make test-func

  and

      ./toolbox/run bash -c "FUNC_TEST_ARGS='--skip-tags test_network' make test-func"

  The 2nd case perhaps deserves some improvement (list of env vars we
  want to detect and pass into toolbox container automatically?) but
  that's beyond the scope of this commit.
- Split documentation between developer and user parts. [Jiri Stransky]
- Exclude docs from CI. [Carlos Camacho]
- Fix qos_policy ref in Network and remove TODOs. [Jiri Stransky]

  Fix a case of copypasta in network_refs_from_ser function.

  Remove the TODOs related to the Network refs. Originally i wanted to
  load also project_name and subnet_names list, but those are not
  necessary for importing under current OS-Migrate assumptions, and
  fetching this information in network_refs_from_sdk and
  network_refs_from_ser would slow down the import/export with
  unnecessary API requests. For now let's assume this info does not need
  to be queried, we can re-evaluatethe decision if we get any hints that
  this info would be useful.
- Add utility functions for fetching references. [Jiri Stransky]
- References handling for import/export. [Jiri Stransky]

  ID-based references to other resources need to be converted to
  name-based ones on export, and back to ID-based ones during
  import. This is now implemented for Network's
  qos_policy_id/qos_policy_name reference.

  The functions which talk to OpenStack API are still kept separate from
  functions which only do serialization/deserialization data
  mangling. This makes testing and hopefully also reasoning about what
  happens where a bit easier.

  There's perhaps still opportunity to extract some of the reference
  handling code into a new utility Python module, and add more
  references to Network (its Project name and contained Subnet
  names). This can be expanded on in another commit.
- DRY parameter copying in serialization. [Jiri Stransky]

  This DRY code doesn't reduce line count but it does simplify it
  conceptually and is less prone to typos.
- Check that what is passed into serialize_network is indeed Network.
  [Jiri Stransky]
- Network import idempotence. [Jiri Stransky]

  For idempotence of imports we largely have all the pieces, all that
  needs to be done is to serialize the existing network into our format
  and compare if the resulting 'params' are the same as the ones
  provided to the import_network module.

  Crucial is looking at 'params' only and not 'info', as 'params'
  contain the important network parameters that are meant to be
  migrated, while 'info' contains non-migratable info, e.g. the
  network's UUID.
- Export idempotence common code, tests, idempotence for Networks. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  This adds export idempotence common code - when replacing a resource
  in a resource YAML file, we first check if indeed anything changed. If
  it didn't, we don't overwrite that resource and don't even write into
  the file.

  This is now utilized for Network resources specifically. Some things
  coming from OpenStack API seem to have non-deterministic order,
  e.g. the list of networks itself, or list of subnet IDs in a
  Network. To make the idempotence work properly, i've added sorting
  where applicable.

  Functional tests which re-execute the export and check that the file
  content is the same are added.
- Ansible.cfg for func tests - timestamps and nicer output. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  The profile_tasks callback plugin adds timestamps, allowing us to
  check what actions took how long. And YAML log output is generally
  easier/faster to read than the non-indented JSON.
- Wait until the Devstack fix is merged. [Carlos Camacho]

  We need to wait until https://review.opendev.org/#/c/704136/
  is merged to remove the pin.
- Design doc - challenges of problem domain and how we deal with them.
  [Jiri Stransky]

  This is part of the design doc which i forgot to transfer from Tmit
  [1]. It is useful to have this rationale captured.

  [1] https://gitlab.com/jistr/tmit/blob/4559f58718f133e8ce44e50f31fef8485ff66fc7/doc/design.md#L107-121
- Make 'build.sh' use 'releases' dir and make 'publish.sh' use
  'build.sh' [Carlos Camacho]
- Build and publish the collection to Galaxy. [Carlos Camacho]

  This patch builds on each merge a new version of the collection,
  then this build should be published to Galaxy.
- Update version in const.py based on galaxy.yml when building the
  collection. [Jiri Stransky]

  Initially i wanted to just load the collection manifest from const.py,
  but it's not possible, more details at [1].

  Our next best shot is probably to auto-update const.py constant
  OS_MIGRATE_VERSION each time we build the collection, which is what
  this commit implements.

  Closes #12
- Use network class from the .network. openstacksdk submodule. [Jiri
  Stransky]

  I was initially surprised that the network object from openstacksdk is
  inconsistent between creation and fetching, and then i realized that
  openstacksdk probably has 2 different Python APIs. The
  Connection.get_network() function returns a different object than
  Connection.network.find_network().

  I'm guessing the API calls directly on Connection are older and we
  should probably avoid using them. On brief inspection, the code under
  .network. seems better documented and a somewhat nicer API. It is also
  the way recommended in the relevant guide:

  https://docs.openstack.org/openstacksdk/train/user/guides/network.html
- Resource file reading and networks import. [Jiri Stransky]

  The import_networks playbook and role, and import_network module are
  for importing networks specifically.

  The read_resources module is meant for all importing in general. It
  loads the resource YAML file structure into an Ansible variable so
  that individual resources can be iterated on inside the roles.

  Small deserialization utility functions are added too, for
  transforming serialized data into parameters for OpenStack SDK when
  creating/updating resources.

  There is a block in functional tests that isn't very nice but it can
  be fully removed once we implement name-based filtering on export:

  https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate/issues/22
- Add minor fixes to unit/functional tests and readme. [Carlos Camacho]

  This patch add:

  * Adds a name convention for the tests, currently [unit|functional]-all
  where all should be replaced for the specific type of tests that need
  to run, i.e. unit-network or functional-network.

  * Moves the functional tests to run with latest python 3.7.

  * Removes unneeded python versions in unit tests.

  * Improves the README with links to current tests for merged commmits.

  * Add a very initial logo for the project.
- Add serialization basics and network exporting. [Jiri Stransky]

  This adds serialization and resource file read/write basics, and adds
  rudimentary network exporting.

  We may further think whether using some classes for our structures
  makes sense, or if just plain dict/list structures are good enough (my
  initial approach in this commit). Given that Python is a dynamic
  language, we won't get any compile time validation even if we do add
  classes/structures for the data, and any errors will pop up at runtime
  either way. This already manifested in dealing with the openstacksdk's
  Network class -- even though it's a class, it didn't feel like we're
  getting many benefits from it over a plain dict, it is very free-form,
  see serialization method in network.py.
- Fix filesystem ownership in CI. [Jiri Stransky]

  We were hitting weird issues in filesystem ownership [1] which failed
  devstack install. Making sure the ownership is correct seems to fix
  the problems.

- Add CI. [Carlos Camacho]
- Improve documentation. [Carlos Camacho]
- Add a note about Vagrant VM lifespan being tied to vagrant-shell.
  [Jiri Stransky]
- Prevent nesting of toolbox commands. [Jiri Stransky]
- Rough draft of workflow on Ansible level. [Jiri Stransky]

  This is a very high-level idea of how we might structure the workflow
  to give a decent debuggability and hackability of our Ansible-based
  tooling.
- High-level development goals. [Jiri Stransky]

  This list was originally for Tmit PoC (https://gitlab.com/jistr/tmit),
  and i think a lot of it could apply for OS-Migrate, so i post it here,
  with minor amendments.
- Add network serialization stub code. [Jiri Stransky]

  The data from serialized network is split between "params" and "info",
  the idea being that params are important values which are needed when
  importing the network, while info are not used when importing but
  might be useful for a human looking through the exported data.
- Call vagrant-up from vagrant-snapshot-revert if needed. [Jiri
  Stransky]
- Fix for Fedora 31 vagrant-run. [Jiri Stransky]

  It seems that /etc/qemu isn't required but /dev/net is.
- Update toolbox to F31, mount /etc/qemu for Vagrant. [Jiri Stransky]
- Vagrant container - get rid of env vars which are undefined on Fedora
  31. [Jiri Stransky]
- Add skeleton for unit and sanity tests. [Jiri Stransky]

  This adds Makefile targets "test-sanity", "test-unit" and a shorthand
  target for both, called "test-fast". The ansible-test tool is used for
  sanity and unit testing, and an empty unit test is added to show that
  the unit tests run.
- Autodetect whether containers run interactively. [Jiri Stransky]

  This automatically enables e.g. colored terminal output.
- Add a stub of network exporting. [Jiri Stransky]

  This is a very rough "i do nothing yet" prototype, but it should give
  us something to talk about re structuring the code and tests. It is
  exercised from the functional tests already.
- Func tests now seed and clean up a network. [Jiri Stransky]
- Clarify functional tests' clouds.yaml. [Jiri Stransky]
- Remove Vagrant's clouds.yaml, fix gitignore. [Jiri Stransky]
- Make it possible to run functional tests just for network migration.
  [Jiri Stransky]
- Rename test_full to test_all. [Jiri Stransky]
- Document how to run functional tests. [Jiri Stransky]
- Test-func target depends on reinstall. [Jiri Stransky]

  Prior to using a collection, it needs to be installed in ~/.ansible in
  the toolbox container, so tests should make sure we've built and
  installed the latest state.
- Functional tests skeleton. [Jiri Stransky]
- Add python3-devel to toolbox and openstacksdk to virtualenv. [Jiri
  Stransky]
- Make targets for building and installing the collection. [Jiri
  Stransky]
- Go for os_migrate namespace right away. [Jiri Stransky]

  It seems that the 'jistr' namespace might be referenced in may places,
  let's just go for 'os_migrate' anticipated namespace right away and
  we'll request it before publishing, or figure out alternatives then.
- One more note about naming. [Jiri Stransky]
- Fix capitalization in readme. [Jiri Stransky]
- Document dev env setup steps. [Jiri Stransky]

- Add run/shell commands with venv active inside. [Jiri Stransky]
- Interactive editing of toolbox image. [Jiri Stransky]
- Move virtualenv into the container image. [Jiri Stransky]
- Move venv setup into its subdir. [Jiri Stransky]
- Add license file -- Apache 2.0. [Jiri Stransky]
- Add vagrantized devstack for running tests against (for now) [Jiri
  Stransky]

  I guess ideally we'd deploy something more stable like RDO TripleO
  Standalone, but i had devstack for now which i've written for Tmit
  project, so let's start with that for now.
- Generated Ansible collection skeleton. [Jiri Stransky]
- Add virtualenv for locking Python deps. [Jiri Stransky]

  Pip install in the virtualenv only works if the toolbox is started
  with --security-opt label=disable.

- Naming convention - underscores rather than hyphens. [Jiri Stransky]
- Init. [Jiri Stransky]
