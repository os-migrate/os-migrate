Contributing Code
=================

As an open source project, OS Migrate welcomes contributions from the
community at large. The following guide provides information on how to
add a new role to the project and where additional testing or
documentation artifacts should be added. This isn’t an exhaustive
reference and is a living document subject to change as needed when
the project formalizes any practice or pattern.

Adding a New Role
-----------------

The most common contribution to OS Migrate is adding a new role to
support the export or import of resources. The construction of the roles
will likely follow a similar pattern. Each role also has specific unit
and functional test requirements. The most common pattern for adding a
new role will follow these steps:

-  Add a resource class to ``os_migrate/plugins/module_utils`` that
   inherits from
   ``ansible_collections.os_migrate.os_migrate.plugins.module_utils.resource.Resource``

-  Add a unit test to ``os_migrate/tests/unit`` to test serializing and
   de-serializing data, and any other functionality your class may have.

-  Create a new module in ``os_migrate/plugins/modules`` to facilitate
   the import or export of the resource.

-  Add a new playbook to ``os_migrate/playbooks``.

-  Add a new role to ``os_migrate/roles``.

-  Add functional tests to ``tests/func`` that test primary use,
   idempotency, and updates as a minimum. Additional tests as necessary.

-  Add documentation within classes and roles/playbooks as required.
   Update developer or user documentation as needed.


Creating the role skeleton automatically
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adding roles into os-migrate can be easily achieved by
creating the role structure skeleton automatically.


From the repository root directory execute:

.. code:: bash

   ansible-playbook \
      -i 'localhost,' \
      ./scripts/role-addition.yml \
      -e ansible_connection=local \
      -e role_name=import_example_resource

This command will generate the role, the default variables file,
and the documentation stub.


Resources
~~~~~~~~~

Resources are the primary data structures that are exported from and
imported to clouds. In
``os_migrate/plugins/module_utils/resource.py``, there is a
``Resource`` class provided for your new resource to inherit from. It
provides a way to quickly build an organized class that uses
openstacksdk to retrieve, create and update data within a connected
OpenStack tenant. See how other classes in the ``module_utils``
directory inherit from ``Resource`` for inspiration.

Two very important properties are the ‘params’ and ‘_info’, as these are
the primary data fields that will be exported and imported. At a
minimum, the name property of any resource should be in params_from_sdk,
and most likely addresses should be there too. The difference between
info and params is:

-  A property that would be an ‘_info’ type is something that we don’t
   want or cannot “make the same” in the destination cloud. For example,
   typically UUIDs can’t be the same between two tenants so an ‘id’
   property should remain in info.

-  A property that would be in a ‘params’ type are things that we do
   want to copy to the destination cloud. These typically also get
   looked at when we’re making sure the import behavior is idempotent.
   I.e. when we re-run import playbooks, things that already got
   imported before are not attempted to be imported again.

Export Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``defaults/main.yml`` file, at a minimum you will need to
define the ``os_migrate_[resource]_filter`` variable to support
filtering of resources by the name property.

In the ``meta/main.yml`` file you will likely just need to add the
following default content:

.. code:: yaml

   ---
   galaxy_info:
     author: os-migrate
     description: os-migrate resource
     company: Red Hat
     license: Apache-2.0
     min_ansible_version: "2.9"
     platforms:
       - name: Fedora
         versions:
           - "34"
     galaxy_tags: ["osmigrate"]
   dependencies:
     - role: os_migrate.os_migrate.prelude_src

In the ``tasks/main.yml`` file, add your Ansible tasks for exporting the
data. A common pattern is retrieving data from an OpenStack tenant via a
`cloud
module <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/openstack/cloud/index.html>`__
, creating a collection of name/id pairs for export, filtering the names
for specific resources, and then calling the module you created for
export.

Import Roles
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the ``defaults/main.yml`` file, at a minimum you will need to
define the same ``os_migrate_[resource]_filter`` variable as with
export, and ``import_[resource]_validate_file: true`` variable to set
whether or not the import data file should be validated for this
role. In most cases, it should be set to ``true``.

In the ``meta/main.yml`` file you will likely just need to add the
following default content:

.. code:: yaml

   ---
   galaxy_info:
     author: os-migrate
     description: os-migrate resource
     company: Red Hat
     license: Apache-2.0
     min_ansible_version: "2.9"
     platforms:
       - name: Fedora
         versions:
           - "34"
     galaxy_tags: ["osmigrate"]
   dependencies:
     - role: os_migrate.os_migrate.prelude_dst

In the ``tasks/main.yml`` file, add your Ansible tasks for importing the
data. A common pattern is validating the data file created by the
associated export role, reading the data file and then calling the
module you created for import.


Necessary Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this is your first time adding a pull request to the os-migrate
repository, add your author information to ``galaxy.yml``.

In each Ansible module in ``os_migrate/plugins/modules``, there is a
``DOCUMENTATION`` constant where you must provide standard
documentation on what the module does and an example of how you would
use it in a playbook.

Each new role must have a ``README.md`` file as a requirement for
Ansible Galaxy publishing.
