General Contribution Guidelines
===============================

Commit Messages for Changelog
-----------------------------

OS Migrate uses commit messages for automated generation of project
changelog. For every pull request we request contributors to be
compliant with the following commit message notation.

Format
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    <type>: <summary>

    <body>

Accepted ``<type>`` values:

-  `new` - newly implemented user-facing features

-  `chg` - changes in existing user-facing features

-  `fix` - user-facing bugfixes

-  `oth` - other changes which users should know about

-  `dev` - any developer-facing changes, regardless of
   new/chg/fix status


Keeping Changelog Clean
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the commit message subject starts with `dev:`, it will be omitted
when rendering the changelog.

Using this convention is important to keep the changelog document
concise and focused on user-facing changes. Any developer-facing
changes (developer environment, CI, developer-only docs) or miniature
"cosmetic" edits should be tagged as `dev`.


Summary (First Line)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first line should not be longer than 75 characters, the second
line is always blank and other lines should be wrapped at 80
characters.


Message Body
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uses the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor
“changes” and includes motivation for the change and contrasts with
previous behavior. Think how the commit message will appear in the
project changelog.
