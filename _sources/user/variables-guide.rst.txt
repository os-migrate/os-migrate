Variables Guide
===============

The goal of this document is to guide users to correctly configure the
most important variables in OS Migrate. For a complete listing of
variables configurable for each Ansible role, refer to the
documentation of the individual roles.

General variables
-----------------

Resource filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resource filters allow the user to control which resources will be
migrated. The filters match against resource **names**.

The filters work **both during export and during import**, and it is
not required that the same value is used during export and
import. This feature can be used e.g. to export a subset of the
existing resources, and then during import further limit the subset of
resources being imported into batches.

The value of a filter variable is a list, where each item can be a
string (exact match) or a dictionary with ``regex`` key (regular
expression match). A resource is exported if it matches at least one
of the list items.

.. code:: yaml

   os_migrate_networks_filter:
     - my_net
     - other_net
     - regex: ^myprefix_.*

The above example says: Export only networks named ``my_net`` **or**
``other_net`` **or** starting with ``myprefix_``.

The filters default to:

.. code:: yaml

   - regex: .*

meaning "export all resources". (The set of resources exported will
still be limited to those you can see with the authentication
variables you used.)

Sometimes two roles use the same variable where this makes sense,
especially for attached resources. E.g. roles
``export_security_groups`` and ``export_security_group_rules`` both
use ``os_migrate_security_groups_filter``. Similarly,
``export_routers`` and ``export_router_interfaces`` both use
``os_migrate_routers_filter``.

List of the currently implemented filters with default values you can
copy into your variables file and customize:

.. code:: yaml

   os_migrate_flavors_filter:
     - regex: .*
   os_migrate_images_filter:
     - regex: .*
   os_migrate_keypairs_filter:
     - regex: .*
   os_migrate_networks_filter:
     - regex: .*
   os_migrate_projects_filter:
     - regex: .*
   os_migrate_routers_filter:
     - regex: .*
   os_migrate_security_groups_filter:
     - regex: .*
   os_migrate_subnets_filter:
     - regex: .*
   os_migrate_users_filter:
     - regex: .*
   os_migrate_workloads_filter:
     - regex: .*


Conversion host variables
-------------------------

The following variables are those that need to be configured prior to
running OS Migrate.

Conversion host name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conversion hosts might be configured using different names,
this is in case an operator needs to have them registered
with the subscription manager and avoid collisions with the names.

The conversion hosts names can be customized using the
following variables::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_host_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_host_name

By default, these variables have the same value
for both conversion hosts `os_migrate_conv_src`
and `os_migrate_conv_dst` respectively.

Conversion host image name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conversion host image is the guest configure to execute the
instances migrations.

The variables to be configured are::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_image_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_image_name

This image must be accessible to both tenants/projects prior to
executing the conversion host deployment playbook. The variables
default to ``os_migrate_conv``, so if a conversion host image is
uploaded to Glance as public image with this name (in both src and dst
clouds), these variables do not need to be configured explicitly.

Make sure this image exists in Glance on both clouds.  Currently it
should be a
`CentOS 9 Cloud Image <https://cloud.centos.org/centos/9-stream/x86_64/images/CentOS-Stream-GenericCloud-9-20220914.0.x86_64.qcow2>`_
or
`RHEL 8 KVM Guest Image <https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/479/ver=/rhel---8/8.3/x86_64/product-software>`_.

Conversion host flavor name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conversion host flavor defines the compute, memory, and storage
capacity that will be allocated for the conversion hosts. It needs to
have at least a volume with 20GB.

The variables to be configured are::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_flavor_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_flavor_name

Usually, ‘m1.medium’ will suffice this requirement, but again, it can
be different between deployments.

Conversion host external network name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The external network configuration allows the connection of the
conversion host router for external access, this external network must
be able to allocate floating IPs reachable between both conversion
hosts.

Set the name of the external (public) network to which conversion host
private subnet will be attached via its router, for source and
destination clouds respectively, via these variables::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_external_network_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_external_network_name

This is not required if you are attaching your conversion host to
pre-existing network (when
`os_migrate_src/dst_conversion_manage_network` is `false`).

Other conversion host dependency names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the name variables described above, it is possible to
customize names of other conversion host dependency resources::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_net_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_net_name
    os_migrate_src_conversion_subnet_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_subnet_name
    os_migrate_src_conversion_router_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_router_name
    os_migrate_src_conversion_secgroup_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_secgroup_name
    os_migrate_src_conversion_keypair_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_keypair_name

Conversion host availablility zone management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Availability zones are defined by attaching specific metadata
information to an aggregate::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_availability_zone
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_availability_zone

The conversion host can set logical abstractions for partitioning
instances to a specific set of hosts belonging to an aggregate.

The default is `false` (meaning no specification provided).

Conversion host network management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to disable creation and deletion of conversion host
private network by setting these variables to `false`::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_manage_network
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_manage_network

This disables creation of the network, the subnet, and the router that
typically makes the conversion host reachable from outside the cloud.

When disabling network management like this, you'll need pre-existing
network that the conversion host can attach to and use it to talk to
the other conversion host. Set these network name variables
accordingly::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_net_name
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_net_name

Conversion host floating IP management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OS Migrate can be told to not attempt to create any floating IPs on
the conversion hosts. This can be useful when attaching a conversion
host to some public network, where its IP address will be
automatically reachable from outside. The variables to control whether
conversion hosts should have floating IPs are::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_manage_fip
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_manage_fip

When the conversion hosts are removed, the required and
assigned floating IPs need to be detached or removed.

The following variables allow to change the behavior
of deleting of detaching the floating IP when deleting the conversion
hosts (default: true)::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_host_delete_fip
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_host_delete_fip

When the corresponding `..._manage_fip` variable is set to `false`,
floating IP deletion is not attempted even if `..._delete_fip` is set
to `true`.

Conversion host specific floating IP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each conversion host needs to have a floating IP,
these floating IPs can be assigned automatically or
defined by the operator with the usage of the
following variables::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_floating_ip_address
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_floating_ip_address

When using this variable to specify an exact IP address, the floating
IP must already exist and be available for attaching.

Attaching conversion hosts onto public networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A combination of variables described earlier can be used to attach the
conversion hosts directly onto pre-existing public networks. We need
to make sure that we don't try to create any private network, we don't
try to create a floating IP, and we set the conversion host network
names accordingly::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_manage_network: false
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_manage_network: false
    os_migrate_src_conversion_manage_fip: false
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_manage_fip: false
    os_migrate_src_conversion_net_name: some_public_net_src
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_net_name: some_public_net_dst

Storage migration modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modes for workload migrations can be changed in either
cloud. The variable that control the behavior are::

    os_migrate_workloads_data_copy

The default is `true` (meaning the copying of data using
os-migrate is skipped).

This is useful if there are pre-created volumes in the
destination cloud that we just want to attach when creating
the VM in the destination.


Conversion host boot from volume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conversion hosts can be created as boot-from-volume servers in
either cloud. The variables that control the behavior are::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_host_boot_from_volume
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_host_boot_from_volume

The default is `false` (meaning boot from Nova local disk).

When creating boot-from-volume conversion hosts, it is possible to
customize the size in GB for the boot volume::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_host_volume_size
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_host_volume_size

The size should be 20 or more, the default is 20.


Conversion host RHEL variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using RHEL as conversion host, set the SSH user name as follows::

    os_migrate_conversion_host_ssh_user: cloud-user

It is also necessary to set RHEL registration variables. The
variables part of this role are set to ``omit`` by default.

The variables `os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_auto_attach`
and `os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_activationkey` are mutually
exclusive, given that, they are both defaulted to omit.

Typically the only registration variables to set are::

    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_username
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_password

In this case, `os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_auto_attach` should be set to `True`
in order to fetch automatically the content once the node is registered.

or::

    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_activationkey
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_org_id

For this case, `os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_auto_attach` must be left
undefined with its default value of `omit`.

The complete list of registration variables corresponds to the
`redhat_subscription <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/redhat_subscription_module.html>`_
Ansible module. In OS Migrate they are named as follows::

    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_activationkey
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_auto_attach
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_consumer_id
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_consumer_name
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_consumer_type
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_environment
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_force_register
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_org_id
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_password
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_pool
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_pool_ids
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_release
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_rhsm_baseurl
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_rhsm_repo_ca_cert
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_server_hostname
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_server_insecure
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_server_proxy_hostname
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_server_proxy_password
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_server_proxy_port
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_server_proxy_user
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_syspurpose
    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_username

Additionally is possible to enable specific repositories in the
conversion hosts using the following variable::

    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_repositories

The `os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_repositories` variable is a
list of those repositories that will be enabled on the conversion
host.

Enabling password-based SSH access to the conversion hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When required, a user can configure password-based SSH access to
the conversion hosts, this feature might be useful for debugging
when the private key of the hosts is not available anymore.

The variables required in order to configure the password-based
access are named as follows::

    os_migrate_conversion_host_ssh_user_enable_password_access
    os_migrate_conversion_host_ssh_user_password

The variable `os_migrate_conversion_host_ssh_user_enable_password_access`
is set by default to `false`, and the variable
`os_migrate_conversion_host_ssh_user_password` is set by default to the
following string `weak_password_disabled_by_default`.

The user enabled to access the conversion hosts with password-based authentication
is the one defined in the `os_migrate_conversion_host_ssh_user` variable.

Running custom bash scripts in the conversion hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to run custom bash scripts in the conversion
hosts before and after configuring their content.
The content of the conversion hosts is a set of required packages
and in the case of using RHEL then the configuration of the
subscription manager.

The variables allowing to run the custom scripts are::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_host_pre_content_hook
    os_migrate_src_conversion_host_post_content_hook
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_host_pre_content_hook
    os_migrate_dst_conversion_host_post_content_hook

The Ansible module used to achieve this is shell,
so users can execute a simple one-liner command, or more
complex scripts like the following examples::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_host_pre_content_hook: |
      ls -ltah
      echo "hello world"
      df -h

or::

    os_migrate_src_conversion_host_pre_content_hook: "echo 'this is a simple command'"

Disabling the subscription manager tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to disable the subscription manager
native tasks by setting to false the following variable::

    os_migrate_conversion_rhsm_manage

This will skip the tasks related to RHSM when using RHEL
in the conversion hosts. Disabling RHSM can be useful in
those cases where the operator has custom scripts they
need to use instead the standard Ansible module.

OpenStack REST API TLS variables
--------------------------------

If either of your clouds uses TLS endpoints that are not trusted by
the Migrator host by default (e.g. using self-signed certificates), or
if the Migrator host should authenticate itself via key+cert, you will
need to set TLS-related variables.

-  ``os_migrate_src_validate_certs`` / ``os_migrate_dst_validate_certs`` -
   Setting these to ``false`` disables certificate validity checks of
   the source/destination API endpoints.

-  ``os_migrate_src_ca_cert`` / ``os_migrate_dst_ca_cert`` - These
   variables allow you to specify a custom CA certificate that should
   be used to validate the source/destination API certificates.

-  ``os_migrate_src_client_cert``, ``os_migrate_src_client_key`` /
   ``os_migrate_dst_client_cert``, ``os_migrate_dst_client_key`` - If the
   Migrator host should authenticate itself using a TLS key +
   certificate when talking to source/destination APIs, set these
   variables.

Workload import/export variables
--------------------------------

- ``os_migrate_workload_stop_before_migration`` - Set to true if you wish
  for os_migrate to stop your workloads/vms prior to migration. Note that
  only workloads/vms in `SHUTOFF` state will be migrated.

Workload migration variables
----------------------------
Workloads to be migrated with OS Migrate can have varying storage configurations in
the source cloud, and the desired way to migrate their storage also varies, per cloud
operators preference.

The following table summarizes the matrix of options (whats in the source, how
it should be migrated, how should OS Migrate workloads YAML file be configured,
is the conversion host required for this mode of migration, is this migration
mode implemented).
