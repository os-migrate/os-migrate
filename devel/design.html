<h2>High-level development goals<a class="headerlink" href="#high-level-development-goals" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I/O-based. Fetch metadata and/or content from source cloud -&gt; write
them as outputs -&gt; read them as inputs -&gt; push it to the destination
cloud. This allows other tools to enter the phase between the “write
output” and “read input”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E.g. arbitrary/custom yaml-parsing tools can be used as a smart
filter to analyze the exported contents from source cloud and
choose what (not) to import into the destination cloud.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes (e.g. in workload migration) only metadata may be
written out and editable on the migrator machine, and the actual
binary data is transferred in a direct path between the clouds
for performance reasons.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Logging. When contributing code, don’t forget about logging and how
will information be presented to the user. Try to think about what
can potentially fail and what kind of log output might help figuring
out what went wrong, and on the contrary, what kind of log output
would add clutter without much information value.</p></li>
<li><p>Testing. Unit-test semantics of small parts wherever possible.
Emphasize automated functional tests (end-to-end, talking to a real
OpenStack backend). Functional tests are closest to the real use
cases and provide at least basic level of comfort that the software
does what it should.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoid excessive mocking in unit tests. Focus on writing unit
tests for self-contained (pure) functions/methods, and structure
the code so that as much as possible is written as pure
functions/methods. When this is not possible, consider writing
functional/end-to-end tests instead of unit tests.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Always talking to OpenStack via API. The tool must be able to be
deployed externally to both source and destination clouds. No looking
at DBs or other hacks. If we hit a hurdle due to no-hacks approach,
it could mean that OpenStack’s capabilities for tenant-to-tenant
content migration are lacking, and an RFE for OpenStack might be
required.</p></li>
<li><p>Idempotency where possible. When a command fails, it should be
possible to retry with the same command.</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever simplicity / understandability / clarity gets into conflict
with convenience / ease-of-use, we prefer simplicity /
understandability / clarity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prefer running several CLI commands to do something where each
command is simple and human can enter the process by amending
inputs/outputs e.g. with additional tools or a text editor,
rather than one magical command which aims to satisfy all use
cases and eventually turns out to satisfy very few, and tends to
fail in mysterious ways with partial completion and limited
re-runnability.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>OS Migrate is intended to be a building block for tenant migrations
rather than a push-button solution. The assumption is that to cover
needs of a particular tenant migration, a knowledgeable human is
running OS Migrate manually and/or has tweaked it to their needs.</p></li>

<h2>Challenges of the problem domain<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-of-the-problem-domain" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Generally, admins can view resources of all projects, but cannot
create resources in those projects (unless they have a role in the
project). To create a resource under a project, either credentials of
the target non-admin user have to be used for importing, or the admin
user has to be added into the project for the duration of the import.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This is not true for <em>some</em> resources. As of January 2020,
e.g. networking resources can be created under arbitrary
domain/project by admin using Networking API v2, but it’s not the
case for e.g. volumes, servers, keypairs. At least initially, we
will assume the general scenario that we’re running the migration
as the tenant who owns the resources on both src/dst sides.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>OpenStack doesn’t have strict requirements on resource naming
(doesn’t require non-empty, unique names). The migration tool will
enforce names which are non-empty, and unique per resource type. This
is to allow idempotent imports, which is necessary for retrying
imports on failure. The tool should allow to export/serialize
resources that are not properly named, but the exported data should
fail validation and be refused when fed into the import command.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the future, if we implement running all migrations as admin
(might need OpenStack RFEs) instead of the tenant, we’d perhaps
require uniqueness per resource type per tenant, rather than just
per resource type.</p></li>

<h2>Basic Ansible workflow design<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-ansible-workflow-design" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The challenge and a goal here is to give meaningful Ansible log
output for debugging. This means, for example, that we shouldn’t have
a single Ansible task (one module call) to export/import the whole
tenant, and we should also consider not having a single task to
export/import all resources of some type. Ideally, each resource
export/import would have its own module call (own task in Ansible
playbook), so if the export or import fails, we can easily tell which
resource was the one that caused a failure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We have a YAML file per resource type. Export modules are able to
add a resource (idempotently) to an existing YAML file without
affecting the rest. There is reusable code for this idempotence.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example workflow: export networks. Provided playbook.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ansible task, provided: fetch metadata (at least name and ID, but
perhaps the more the better for advanced filtering) of all
networks that are visible for the tenant, register a list
variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Ansible task(s) optionally added by user into our playbook on
per-environment basis: filter the metadata according to custom
needs, re-register the list var.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Eventually we may want to provide some hooks here, but
initially we’d be fine with users simply editing the provided
playbook.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Ansible task, provided: filter networks by names, either via exact
matches or via regexes.</p></li>
<li><p>Anisble task, provided, calling our custom module: Iterate
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loop</span></code>) over the list of metadata, and call our module which
will fetch the data and write a YAML with our defined format for
Network resources. If necessary, do any data mangling here to
satisfy the format requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example workflow: transform networks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initially we will not provide any tooling here, but at this point
the user should have a YAML file (or a bunch of them) with the
serialized resources. They can use any automation (Ansible, yq,
sed, …) to go through them and edit as they please before
importing.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Example workflow: import networks. Provided playbook.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ansible task, provided: read the serialized YAML networks into
memory, register a list variable.</p></li>
<li><p>Anisble task, provided: Iterate (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loop</span></code>) over the list of
networks, and call an Ansible module to create each network. We’ll
want to create our own module here to deal with our file format
specifics, but underneath we may be calling the community
OpenStack Ansible module if that proves helpful.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We may want to consider using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tags</span></code> on our tasks to allow some
sub-executions. However, it may be that chunking up the code and
using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import_playbook</span></code> might be more clear and safe to use than
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tags</span></code> in many cases. If we do happen to add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tags</span></code>, they
shouldn’t be added wildly, use cases should be thought through and
documented for both users and developers. Tags need clarity and
disciplined use in order to be helpful.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The above talks about tags in end-user code. We do use tags in
our test suites, and it’s much less sensitive there as we can
change those tags any time without breaking user expectations.</p></li>
