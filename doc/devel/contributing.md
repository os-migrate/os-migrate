Become a Contributor
====================

As an open source project, OS-Migrate welcomes contributions from the community
at large.  The following guide provides information on how to add a new role
to the project and where additional testing or documentation artifacts should be
added.  This isn't an exhaustive reference and is a living document subject to
change as needed when the project formalizes any practice or pattern.

Adding a New Role
-------------
The most common contribution to OS-Migrate is adding a new role to support the
export or import of resources.  The construction of the roles will likely
follow a similar pattern.  Each role also has specific unit and functional test
requirements.  The most common pattern for adding a new role will follow these
steps:

 - Add a resource class to `os_migrate/plugins/module_utils` that inherits from
   `ansible_collections.os_migrate.os_migrate.plugins.module_utils.resource.Resource`
 
 - Add a unit test to `os_migrate/tests/unit` to test serializing and
   de-serializing data, and any other functionality your class may have.

 - Create a new module in `os_migrate/plugins/modules` to facilitate the import
   or export of the resource.

 - Add a new playbook to `os_migrate/playbooks`.
 
 - Add a new role to `os_migrate/roles`.
 
 - Add functional tests to `tests/func` support primary use, idempotency,
   updates as a minimum.  Additional tests as necessary.
 
 - Add documentation within classes and roles/playbooks as required.  Update
   developer or user documentation as needed.
 
 
Resources
---------
Resources are the primary data that is exported from and imported to clouds.  In
the `os-migrate/os_migrate/plugins/module_utils` directory, there is a
`Resource` class provided for your new resource to inherit from.  It provides
a way to quickly build an organized class that uses openstacksdk to retrieve,
create and update data within a connected OpenStack tenant.

Two very important properties are the 'params' and 'info', as these are the
primary data fields that will be exported and imported.  At a minimum, the name
property of any resource should be in params_from_sdk, and most likely addresses
should be there too. The difference between info and params is:

 - A property that would be an 'info' type is something that we don't want or
   cannot "make the same" in the destination cloud. For example, typically UUIDs
   can't be the same between two tenants so an 'id' property should remain in
   info.

 - A property that would be in a 'params' type are things that we do want
   to copy to the destination cloud. These typically also get looked at when
   we're making sure the import behavior is idempotent. I.e. when we re-run
   import playbooks, things that already got imported before are not attempted
   to be imported again.

The workload migration will probably not "fit existing molds" in some ways so we
will probably be ironing things out over time and finding new patterns, but at
the very least name should move into params (params_from_sdk).

Roles
-----
To create an import or export role, start by adding a [role].yml file to
`os_migrate\playbooks\`.  Next, add your <role> directory to `os_migrate\roles`
with the following layout:

 - [role]
   - defaults
     - main.yml
   - meta
     - main.yml
   - tasks
     - main.yml
   - README.md

Note: The default content for the README.md file is a link to the documentation
within the project.  Unless you have a reason to deviate from that, you can use
the following content:

```markdown
Please refer to
[OS Migrate user docs](https://github.com/os-migrate/os-migrate/blob/main/doc/user/README.md).
```

Export Roles
------------
In the `defaults/main.yml` file, at a minimum you will need to define the
`export_[role]_name_filter` variable to support filtering of resources by the
name property.

In the `meta/main.yml` file you will likely just need to add the following
default content:

```yaml
---
galaxy_info:
  author: os-migrate
  description: os-migrate resource
  company: Red Hat
  license: Apache-2.0
  min_ansible_version: 2.9
  platforms:
    - name: Fedora
      versions:
        - 30
  galaxy_tags: ["os-migrate"]
dependencies:
  - role: os_migrate.os_migrate.prelude_src
```

In the `tasks/main.yml` file, add your Ansible tasks for exporting the data.  A
common pattern is retrieving data from an OpenStack tenant via a
[cloud module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_cloud_modules.html#openstack)
, creating a collection of name/id pairs for export, filtering the names for
specific resources, and then calling the module you created for export. 

Import Roles
------------
In the `defaults/main.yml` file, at a minimum you will need to define the
`import_[role]_validate_file: true` variable to set whether or not the import
data file should be validated for this role.  In most cases, it should be set
to `true`.

```yaml
import_[role]_validate_file: true
```

In the `meta/main.yml` file you will likely just need to add the following
default content:

```yaml
---
galaxy_info:
  author: os-migrate
  description: os-migrate resource
  company: Red Hat
  license: Apache-2.0
  min_ansible_version: 2.9
  platforms:
    - name: Fedora
      versions:
        - 30
  galaxy_tags: ["os-migrate"]
dependencies:
  - role: os_migrate.os_migrate.prelude_dst
```

In the `tasks/main.yml` file, add your Ansible tasks for importing the data.  A
common pattern is validating the data file created by the associated export
role, reading the data file and then calling the module you created for import.
 
Documentation
-------------
If this is your first time adding a pull request to the os-migrate repository,
add your author information to `galaxy.yml`.

Please ensure you comment your code.  If you deviate from the provided patterns
already in the code base, add an explanation.

In each Ansible module in `os_migrate\plugins\modules`, there is a
`DOCUMENTATION` constant where you must provide standard documentation on what
the module does and an example of how you would use it in a playbook.
