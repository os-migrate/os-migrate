General usage notes
-------------------

-  Run against testing/staging clouds first, verify that you are getting
   the expected results.

-  OS-Migrate may not fit each use case out of the box. You can craft
   custom playbooks using the OS-Migrate collection pieces (roles and
   modules) as building blocks.

-  Use the same version of OS-Migrate for export and import. We
   currently do not guarantee that data files are compatible across
   versions.
