The role export_images
scans the available images in the
source tenant, creates an id-name pairs
of the resources to export, filters them
based on a regular expression, and serializes
the result in the output folder.

Then if selected it will export the image blobs
to the destination tenant.

For further information about the role export_images refer to the
[official docs](https://os-migrate.github.io/os-migrate/roles/role-export_images.html).
